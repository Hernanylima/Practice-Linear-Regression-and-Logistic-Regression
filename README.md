Practical Machine Learning

Introduction

This repository aims to provide a practical environment for exploring and implementing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms applied to real-world cases. Through concrete examples, we seek to facilitate the understanding and application of these techniques to solve real-world problems.

Objective

Our focus is to apply machine learning algorithms in different contexts, offering a hands-on and intuitive approach to understanding their functionality and usefulness. The goal is to provide a starting point for those who want to learn and experiment with ML models in various scenarios.

Algorithms and Applications

Below are some of the algorithms and their respective applications included in this repository:

- Linear Regression - Predicting real estate prices based on square footage.

- Logistic Regression - Classifying candidates as passed or failed in assessments.
